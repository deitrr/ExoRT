/n68o2/

This folder contains correlated-k distributions for O2.

Unless noted, all files contain 61 pressures, 17 temperatures, and 8 gauss points.
Spectral intervals and gauss point grid defined in radgrid.F90.
Further descriptions are listed below.

This was put together by Russell Deitrick, following the format and methods 
of other n68equiv molecules processed by Eric Wolf.


All of the cross-sections and resulting
k-table were calculated using HELIOS-K from the HITRAN 2020 line list.

HELIOS-K settings for LW:    1e4 sample points per spectral interval
                             25 cm-1 line cutoff, voigt profile, with plinth,
                             qalpha=0, rrtm gauss point grid

For reference, I've included in this folder the molecule param file that is
generated by the HELIOS-K tools for HITRAN, as it includes the relative
abundances of oxygen isotopes that were assumed. That file is called
'07_hit20.param' <- '07' because oxygen is molecule #7 in HITRAN
