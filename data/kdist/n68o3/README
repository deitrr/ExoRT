/n68o3/

This folder contains correlated-k distributions for O3.

Unless noted, all files contain 61 pressures, 17 temperatures, and 8 gauss points.
Spectral intervals and gauss point grid defined in radgrid.F90.
Further descriptions are listed below.

This was put together by Russell Deitrick, following the format and methods 
of other n68equiv molecules processed by Eric Wolf.


LONGWAVE:
For the long-wave (wavenumbers < ~8000 cm^-1), the cross-sections and resulting
k-tables were calculated using HELIOS-K from the HITRAN 2020 line list.

HELIOS-K settings for LW:    1e4 sample points per spectral interval
                             25 cm-1 line cutoff, voigt profile, with plinth,
                             qalpha=0, rrtm gauss point grid

For reference, I've included in this folder the molecule param file that is
generated by the HELIOS-K tools for HITRAN, as it includes the relative
abundances of ozone isotopes that were assumed. That file is called
'O3_hit20.param'


SHORTWAVE:
For the short-wave (wavenumbers > ~9000 cm^-1), the cross-sections are from
measurements by the MolSpec group at University of Bremen:
https://www.iup.uni-bremen.de/gruppen/molspec/databases/referencespectra/o3spectra2011/index.html

Their methods paper is here:

These cross-sections extend a bit farther in both directions than the HITRAN
cross-sections for O3. The temperature extent of the measurements is 193-293 K.
For temperatures within this range, I interpolated the data to the ExoRT grid.
For temperatures < 193 K or > 293 K, I just used the values at 193 K and 293 K,
respectively. There is no pressure variation in the MolSpec data or in the
resulting k-tables in ExoRT.

The cross-sections were sorted into k-tables using HELIOS-K, by setting
   doStoreFullK = -1
   pathToK = <path to MolSpec cross-section data>

To have HELIOS-K do the sorting, I had to interpolate the MolSpec data onto
the wavenumber grid used for the rest of the ExoRT data, which is set by the
bin edges and the sample points per spectral interval = 1e4. The resulting files
had to have the name Out_o3.dat--this is filename HELIOS-K expects, based on
setting 'name = o3' in the HELIOS-K param.dat input file
